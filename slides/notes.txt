CIKM feedback. Some high level at the moment
- We need to normalize fonts + look & feel (I can do this).
- Trim stuff on certain slides. Some of them are very busy. We can do this at the very end.
- I'd organize the content like this:

1- Introduction
   Terminology and buzz words in DL, IR, NLP, etc.
   How each component is used in IR/NLP (at a high level)
   A bit about building research prototypes and production systems
2- Easy: you are a researcher and practitioner
  What can you do right now with basic efforts
  What other low hanging fruits are out there?
  Research opportunities; pros/cons; pointers to related work
3- Hard
   Academia vs industry
   Build an LLM; crawl the Web, build a production inverted index etc.
   Research opportunities; pros/cons; pointers to related work
4- Medium
    I'd organize on the topics are are more related to IR/NLP and then the ones are a bit more tangential (image stuff)
     Research opportunities; pros/cons; pointers to related work
5- Ugly
      I'd focus on the benchmark/eval first and then bias
      Research opportunities; pros/cons; pointers to related work
6- Conclusions
